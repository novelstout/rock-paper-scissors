This is a part of The Odin Project's "Foundations" course work. In this task, I am going to create a simple game of rock, paper, scissors that runs in the console, and is written in Javascript.

First round of code compelted 4/27/21

Functions were primarily used to create the program, starting with one that generates a number and assigns a value (rock, paper, or scissors) to it, which is stored in a varible.

The next function compares the generated number/value variable with a user input, creating the 'game' of rock, paper, scissors.

Lastly, we have a function that wraps everything into one; first prompting users to input their choice and then runnning the first function to generate a choice for the computer. Next, the second function runs and compares the values and then returns
an a string based on the combination. 

More detailed descriptions can be found in comments within the code, as well as my thought process at the start. 

UPDATE 5/25/21

Alright so I've decided to make this game playable from prompts alone, meaning you won't have to fire up dev tools to see it in action. Once I figure out how to loop, I'll make it so that it can be replayed without refreshing.
